.gs-section-01 h3 { 
     color: red }

.gs-section-01 p {
     font-size: 30px;
}

</style>

### 2. Rename the project to <yourusername>.github.io 

Click on Settings at the top (the cog icon) and on that page you'll have an option to rename the project (Repository name). This will create a website with the Beautiful Jekyll template that will be available at https://<yourusername>.github.io within a couple minutes (check out the FAQ if you want to use a different project name). If after a few minutes your website is still not ready, try making any edit to any file, just to force GitHub to re-build your site.
